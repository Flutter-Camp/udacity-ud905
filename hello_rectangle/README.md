# Hello Rectangle

Created as a new [Flutter](https://flutter.io/) project from commandline. Contains the following files/directories:

 * lib/main.dart - _the Flutter source; main is the entry point for app_
 * android/ - _the android build created from the Flutter source_
 * ios/ - _the iOS build created from the Flutter source_
 * test/ - _the default test harness setup for UI/widget testing_
 * .gitignore - _Git version control; rarely edited_
 * .metadata, .packages - _configuration info; do not edit_
 * .idea - _exists for IntelliJ IDEA config only; .gitignore it_
 * hello_rectangle.iml, hello_rectangle_android.iml - _used by IntelliJ; do not edit._
 * pubspec.yaml - _used to manage [Dart Package](https://www.dartlang.org/tools/pub/pubspec) dependencies_
 
 Run the default created app first, to make sure setup is correct. You should see the "Flutter Demo Home page" with the _You have pushed this button many times_ label. This verifies your app was created and that your IDE is setup to build/run the code.

## Starter Code

Delete the contents of _main.dart_ and replace it with the contents found in this [_starter code_](https://github.com/flutter/udacity-course/blob/master/course/01_hello_rectangle/solution_01_hello_rectangle/lib/main.dart) from the Udacity course.

Build and run it as before. Check that the emulator (or simulator) now shows the updated app screen. This should be a full white screen with a centered green rectangle containing the word "Hello!". _Note: You will see that the IDE will flag the test directory with errors - the default test looks for MyApp, which is no longer existent. We'll fix tests later. For now keep going._
