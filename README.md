# Build Native Mobile Apps With Flutter

Notes from [UD905 - Udacity Course on Flutter](https://www.udacity.com/course/build-native-mobile-apps-with-flutter--ud905) released May 2018 in conjunction with Google I/O. 

The course currently has two parts:

 1. [The Flutter Framework](#1-the-flutter-framework). Focus on fundamentals.
 2. [Building Interactive Apps](#2-building-interactive-apps). Focus on Material Design. 
 
I will capture notes and any additional relevant resources for each lesson in its own Markdown file under the **NOTES** directory and update the _TableOfContents_ below as useful.
